# Dapp Token Exchange (Dex) Project

**Project Description**:  

The **Dapp Token Exchange** is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to facilitate the exchange of ERC-20 tokens without relying on a central authority. I am doing this project for my university final project under a teacher. As I am starting the project now and the teacher has not yet been selected, I have not yet introduced his name. But sure, I will add his name later. 

This project aims to provide a secure, transparent, and decentralized platform for users to trade tokens directly from their wallets, leveraging the principles of decentralized finance (DeFi). The DApp incorporates smart contracts to handle the core functionality of the exchange, including token swaps, liquidity provision, and fee management. Additionally, it features a user-friendly web interface that interacts with the blockchain using Web3.js and Metamask, allowing seamless interaction between users and the exchange.

**Project Objectives**:

-   Develop a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to trade ERC-20 tokens.
-   Implement automated market maker (AMM) functionality to facilitate token swaps using liquidity pools.
-   Ensure that all transactions are trustless and transparent, governed entirely by smart contracts.
-   Build a responsive frontend interface to allow users to connect their wallets and interact with the DApp.

**Key Features**:

-   **ERC-20 Token Compatibility**: Users can trade custom tokens following the ERC-20 standard.
-   **Liquidity Pool**: Users can deposit tokens to liquidity pools, enabling others to trade while earning fees.
-   **Decentralization**: No intermediaries are involved in the token trading process. Smart contracts execute all transactions automatically.
-   **User-Friendly Interface**: A web-based application built with React allows users to easily connect their wallets and interact with the exchange.
-   **Wallet Integration**: Metamask integration enables secure, on-chain token transactions directly from users' wallets.

**Technologies Used**:

-   **Solidity**: For writing smart contracts to govern the DEX operations.
-   **Ethereum Blockchain**: The decentralized platform that hosts the DApp.
-   **Web3.js**: A library for integrating the front end with the Ethereum blockchain.
-   **Truffle/Ganache**: Tools for compiling, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
-   **React & JavaScript**: This is for developing the frontend interface of the DApp.
-   **Metamask**: Wallet extension for secure transaction management on the Ethereum network.

**Expected Outcomes**:

-   A fully functional decentralized token exchange platform.
-   A deeper understanding of blockchain technology, smart contracts, and decentralized finance (DeFi) systems.
-   Practical experience in developing DApps, with a focus on security and decentralized operation.

**Scope of the Project**: This project will focus on the design, development, and deployment of the Dapp Token Exchange. The DApp will be tested and deployed on an Ethereum test network, with potential future deployment on the mainnet. The exchange will demonstrate how decentralized applications can transform traditional financial systems by removing intermediaries and providing users with full control over their assets.
